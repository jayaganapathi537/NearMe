        Perched about 1,515 meters above sea level in the Shevaroy Hills, Yercaud is Salem’s quintessential hill station—often called the “Jewel of the South.” Misty mornings here reveal emerald-green coffee and spice plantations that spill down rolling slopes, while winding roads climb through dense shola forests, offering vantage points such as Lady’s Seat and Pagoda Point with sweeping views over the plains below.
