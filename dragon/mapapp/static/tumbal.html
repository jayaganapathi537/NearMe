    <font face="Georgia" size="5">Tumbal is a quaint rural hamlet situated in the southwestern reaches of Salem district, tucked into the gentle undulations of the Eastern Ghatsâ€™ foothills. Predominantly an agrarian settlement, its red-soil fields yield turmeric, millets, and groundnuts, while small groves of tamarind and guava offer seasonal fruits to local markets </font>
